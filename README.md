Time-honored tradition and first mission in GitHub

Self:   hobbiest walking the path toward professional
XP:     some academic exposure, but more time behind a blinking screen fixing what I broke

Offically, I have been professionaly exposed to IT in network security && network management for alittle > year (as of 20180426). Career-wise, I have transitioned from medical insurance auto-claims to enterprise network management. Intrusion detection and 'red team' philosophy have captured my imagination, and has been my current focus toward my foundation building in my academic pursuits. 

In hopes of creating a strong launching pad in my technical understanding, I have been getting familiar with AWS, CISCO tech, Microsoft products, *NIX navigation/manipulation, (all the Script-Kid stuff, because why not) Kali tools, and foundational understanding of TCP/IP architecture and basic principles of programing (playing with assembly, I really like this . . . it's like a zen rock garden).

Jumping into podcasts like 'the Cyberwire' and 'Packet Pushers' for contemporary exposure.

For educational tools: GNS3 Academy, Linux Academy, Code Academy, (Steam games . . . ), and building personal projects. Certifications pursued: Sec+ has been obtained, next month GCIA will be tackled. I want to get some VMware certs, Linux certs, AWS certs, and CISCO certs. Attendance to more SANS courses would be awesome, but they are so expensive considering I get paid peanuts... and my spending habits on computer based edu/equipment... I'll figure it out. 

I am in awe with the professionals in this industry. Constantly being inspired and humbled everyday, and it drives me to race forward.
